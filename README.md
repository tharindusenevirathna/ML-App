# Machine Learning Web App

This web application, built using **Streamlit**, allows users to apply both **Supervised Learning** and **Unsupervised Learning** algorithms on a dataset. It provides an interactive interface where users can upload a dataset (like the popular **Mushrooms Dataset**) to either classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous using machine learning models, or perform clustering to uncover hidden patterns. The app supports multiple algorithms with customizable hyperparameters for model training and evaluation.

### Key Features:
- **Problem Type Selection**: Choose between Supervised Learning (classification) or Unsupervised Learning (clustering) tasks.
- **Dataset Upload**: Users can upload their own dataset in CSV format.
- **Interactive Algorithm Selection**: Depending on the selected problem type, users can choose the algorithm they want to apply:
  - **Supervised Learning**: Choose from models like **SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Naive Bayes,** and **XGBoost**.
  - **Unsupervised Learning**: Choose from **K-Means** or **Hierarchical Clustering**.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Each algorithm comes with an interface to adjust relevant hyperparameters, allowing users to optimize model performance.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Once the algorithm is selected, the model is trained and evaluated. For supervised tasks, a **confusion matrix** and **classification report** are provided. For unsupervised tasks, a **Silhouette Score** and **PCA visualization** of the clusters are presented.
- **Visualization**: The app uses **matplotlib** and **seaborn** to display evaluation metrics and results visually, making it easy to interpret model performance.

### Technologies Used:
- **Streamlit** for building the web interface.
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms (SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- **XGBoost** for gradient boosting.
- **Pandas** for data handling and preprocessing.
- **Seaborn** and **matplotlib** for data visualization.
- **LabelEncoder** for categorical data encoding.

### How It Works:
1. **Select Problem Type**: 
   - For **Supervised Learning**, the app will train a classification model to predict the target variable (e.g., edible vs. poisonous mushrooms).
   - For **Unsupervised Learning**, the app will perform clustering to find hidden groupings within the dataset.
   
2. **Upload Dataset**: The dataset is preprocessed using **Label Encoding** to handle categorical features.

3. **Choose Algorithm**: The user selects a machine learning algorithm and tunes its hyperparameters using sliders and dropdown menus.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: The app trains the selected model and displays results:
   - For supervised models, users will see evaluation metrics like **classification reports** and **confusion matrices**.
   - For unsupervised models, users will see cluster assignments, a **Silhouette Score**, and **PCA-based visualizations**.
